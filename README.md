## Weekend Project, Jeopardy
Create a Jeopardy app using React.

## Goal
Make something fun, rather then a business app.
### Allow a host to create a game board
	- Input needed is 6 categories, 5 questions and answers for each category.
#### Bonus 
		- Allow host to set question time limit.
		- Allow the host to upload pictures/videos that can be displayed/played when the question is selected.
		- Create a way to upload pre-created game board.
### Display game board
	- Given the board information, display the Jeopardy board.
	- Host is able to click a square to see the question, then click again to show the answer.
	- Once the answer has been shown, return back to the board, and disable that square so that it can't be clicked again.
#### Bonus
		- Display a timer on the questions screen.
### Game rules
	- The game will have two rounds and a final jeopardy.
	- The first round will have one daily double, the second will have two.
	- In the first round the scores will be 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and in the secound round they will be doubled.
### Game flow
	- A player will select a category and score, then the host will click that square.
	- The board will then be hidden, and the question will be displayed.
	- The players will then have a chance to buz in to answer the question.
	- If a player gets it correct or the (bonus) timer ends, then the anwer is displayed, and the board is displayed again with the last asked question unavailable.
